### ‚úÖ The challenge
* Users should be able to:

##  My process
### ‚öíÔ∏è Built with
* Semantic HTML5 markup
* CSS3 custom properties
* Flexbox and Grid for layout
* Vanilla JavaScript
* REST Countries API v3.1
* LocalStorage for theme persistence
* Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
* How to fetch and display data from a public API
* How to use URLSearchParams to read query parameters
* Building dynamic HTML components with JavaScript
* Persisting UI state (dark/light mode) with localStorage
* Debugging and validating API response structures

### Continued development
- In future versions, I‚Äôd like to:
        * Migrate to React or Vue for reusable components
        * Add loading spinners and error boundaries
        * Enhance accessibility (ARIA roles, tab focus)


### Useful resources
* REST Countries API
